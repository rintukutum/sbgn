## Long abstract

**Background**: Visualization of biological processes plays an essential role in life science research. Over time, diverse forms of diagrammatic representations, akin to circuit diagrams, have evolved without well-defined semantics potentially leading to ambiguous network interpretations and difficult programmatic processing.

**Results**: The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standard developed to reduce ambiguity in the visual representation of biomolecular networks. It provides specific sets of well-defined symbols for various types of biological concepts. SBGN comprises three complementary languages: Process Description (PD), Entity Relationship (ER), and Activity Flow (AF). SBGN PD is based on reactions and is well-suited for detailed sequential biochemical mechanisms, for instance, to represent metabolic pathways. SBGN AF shows cascades of influences between the activities carried by biomolecular entities (e.g., stimulation, inhibition) and is particularly useful when the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown or do not need to be shown, for instance, to represent signalling pathways and regulatory networks. SBGN ER represents independent interactions between features of biological entities, which avoids combinatorial explosions of represented biological states and interactions. The XML-based SBGN Markup Language (SBGN-ML) facilitates convenient storage and exchange of SBGN maps, supported by the library libSBGN.

**Discussion**: The SBGN project is an ongoing open community-driven effort coordinated and maintained by an elected international editorial board. Annual workshops, GitHub and mailing lists are used as leading discussion platforms. Major research projects, such as the Virtual Metabolic Human, and pathway databases such as Reactome and WikiPathways display their maps following the SBGN guidelines. Furthermore, a wide range of tools supports SBGN. SBGN regularly offers student coding events through the Google Summer of Code program.

## Short abstract

Visualization of biological processes plays an essential role in life science research. Diverse forms of diagrammatic representations, akin to circuit diagrams, have evolved without well-defined semantics potentially leading to ambiguous network interpretations and difficult programmatic processing.

SBGN is a standard developed to reduce ambiguity in the visual representation of biomolecular networks. It provides specific sets of well-defined symbols for various types of biological concepts. SBGN comprises three complementary languages: Process Description (PD), Activity Flow (AF), and Entity-Relationship (ER). PD allows representing the reactions underlying detailed sequential biochemical mechanisms, as found in metabolic pathways. AF is used to describe cascades of influences between activities of biomolecular entities, for which precise molecular mechanisms might not be known or be neglectable, as those of signalling and regulatory networks. ER permits representing independent interactions between features of biological entities, which avoids combinatorial explosions of represented biological states and interactions. SBGN-ML and the library libSBGN facilitate storage and exchange of maps.

SBGN is a community-driven effort coordinated by elected editors. Workshops, GitHub, and mailing lists are leading discussion platforms. Major research projects, databases, and software tools support SBGN.

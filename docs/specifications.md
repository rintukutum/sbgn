# Specifications

There are three orthogonal and complementary visual languages defined in SBGN: Process Description (PD), Entity Relationship (ER), and Activity Flow (AF). They can be seen as three alternative projections of the underlying, more complex biological information.

## Process Description language

The SBGN *Process Description* (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the molecular interactions taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.

#### Current Specification:

The [SBGN PD language Level 1 Version 1.3](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbgn.pd.level-1.version-1.3) -- Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***, 2015 Sep 4;12(2):263 (doi: 10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-263).


For end-users more than software developers [a user manual is also available](https://github.com/sbgn/process-descriptions/blob/master/UserManual/sbgn_PD-level1-user-public.pdf). 


## Entity Relationship language

The SBGN *Entity Relationship* (ER) language allows you to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.

#### Current Specification:

The [SBGN ER language Level 1 Version 2.0](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbgn.er.level-1.version-2) -- Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***, 2015 Sep 4;12(2):264 (doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-264)


## Activity Flow language

The SBGN *Activity Flow* (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.

#### Current Specification:
The [SBGN AF language Level 1 Version 1.2](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications/sbgn.af.level-1.version-1.2) -- Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***,  2015 Sep 4;12(2):265. (doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-265).
